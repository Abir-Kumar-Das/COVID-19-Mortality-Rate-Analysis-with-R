# COVID-19-Mortality-Rate-Analysis-with-R
This R project investigates age and gender as potential risk factors for COVID-19 mortality.  Data analysis reveals a significant correlation between older age and death, while also suggesting a slightly elevated mortality risk for men compared to women.

**Key Findings:**
* Age is a statistically significant factor: Individuals who died were demonstrably older on average.
* Gender may play a role: While men had a higher average death rate, the difference suggests a slightly increased risk compared to women, with statistical significance at a 99% confidence level.
